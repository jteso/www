<p>Good afterble constanoon, this sweet hongi is as bung as a stuffed morepork. Mean while, in the marae, Dr Ropata and Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy were up to no good with a bunch of bloody troties.</p>

<p>Maui and his rough as guts piece of pounamu, what a stink buzz. Bro, quater-acre patches are really naff good with bung mates, aye. You have no idea how beached as our random kais were aye. Every time I see those beautiful lengths of number 8 wire it’s like Castle Hill all over again aye, do you happen to have a bucket or a hose bro?</p>

<h2 id="h2-headings">H2 Headings</h2>

<p>You have no idea how pretty suss our same same but different toasted sandwiches were aye. Every time I see those carked it keas it’s like the dairy all over again aye, you don’t know his story, bro. Anyway, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson’s Dairy is just Mrs Falani in disguise, to find the true meaning of life, one must start frying up with the hangi, mate. After the rugby ball is jumped the ditch, you add all the stink girl guide biscuits to the trotie you’ve got yourself a meal.</p>

<p>He was alone then; when he sat in that same chair his wife now sits in, and I shared with him the positive result to his HIV test. Though he seemed disinterested, vaguely detached, he had obviously heard of HIV before. His chart from the local clinic indicated a previous history of and treatment for anal gonorrhea, two acute cases of syphilis in the past three years, and a urinary tract infection last month. His only listed sexual contact, his wife. Who, strangely enough, only tested positive for one of the syphilis infections.</p>

<p>“Mistake, this! I am married, not a giver of ass.”</p>

<p>Giver of ass? That’s one for the archive, I think.</p>

<p>Unwilling to engage his obvious denials, I ignore the comment and instead explain that due to a higher than acceptable potential of a false positive result, we won’t consider his oral test as confirmatory until the more accurate blood analysis is in.</p>

<p>“I no understand”, he says to the room in general.</p>

<p>His annoyance is obvious. Abrasively, he offers me his exposed forearm. This, I assume, is my cue to draw his blood. Ignoring the indignant anger beginning to rise, I tighten my jaw, then swab the fat vein with betadine, working the cool, brown liquid off in concentric circles, using strong medicinal smelling alcohol. I use the betadine, as most of these men work in the mines, and dirt three layers thick on exposed skin is the norm. As the first tube in the vacationer fills with blood, he asks,</p>

<p>“So how I get this thing?”</p>

<p>Ah, I see we are going to play the circuitous dance of ignorance. Sounding just a little too clinical, I begin the HIV 101 mantra.</p>

<p>“Well, people acquire HIV through certain types of sex with an infected person, through sharing needles with an infected person, and sometimes through a blood transfusion. Have you ever had a blood transfusion, sir?”</p>

<p>I take the dismissive wave of his hand as a no to the transfusion question. I don’t make a great attempt to navigate a comfort zone here; instinct and experience telling me he has already set the script of what is to follow.</p>

<p>“She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?
Bingo! A narrative that over the next six weeks I will hear from several other men as well.</p>

<p>“These whores, all they want is the cock!”
Careful Skippy, you really aren’t as convincing as you think you are.</p>

<h2 id="chinese-paragraph">Chinese Paragraph</h2>

<p lang="zh-cn">「名词成灾」的流行病里，灾情最严重的该是所谓「科学至上」（scientism）。在现代的工业社会里，科学早成显贵，科技更是骄子，所以知识分子的口头与笔下，有意无意，总爱用一些「学术化」的抽象名词，好显得客观而精确。有人称之为「伪术语」（pseudo-jargon）。例如：明明是 first step，却要说成 initial phase：明明是 letter，却要说成 communication，都属此类。</p>

<p lang="ja">『雪国』の主な舞台は、上越国境の清水トンネルを抜けた湯沢温泉であるが、この作品も『伊豆の踊子』同様に、川端康成の旅の出会いから生まれたもので、雪中の火事も実際に起ったことだと川端は語っている。川端は作品内で故意に地名を隠しているが、1934 年（昭和 9 年）6 月 13 日より 1937 年まで新潟県湯沢町の高半旅館（現：高半ホテル）に逗留していたことを随筆『「雪国」の旅』で述べている。</p>
